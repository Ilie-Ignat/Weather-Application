## About

The weather website will allow the user to check the data on a requested city based on the user input, by fetching the data (Wind Speed, UV Index, Humidity, Temperature) from a json file. Displaying the information across different webpages using visual indication aside from numerical values, it will allow for a quick understanding of the current weather.

## Prerequisites

1. Visual Studio Code
2. The Project's files
3. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension on Visual Studio Code

## Initialization

1. Open the folder in the VS Code editor
2. Press the "Go Live" button on the bottom right corner

## Usage

Following the launch of the website, the user will need to enter a city. If the requested city is typed incorrectly or due to the lack of a larger number of cities, the text "City not found" will appear under the input section. Otherwise the user will be able to go to the following tabs to see the data about the respective city.
City options:

- Dublin
- New York
- Tokyo
- Sydeny
- Berlin
